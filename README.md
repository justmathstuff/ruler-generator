**Ruler generator!!!**

Available at: https://justmathstuff.github.io/ruler-generator/

**The structure of this project**

`index.html` has an `<iframe>`, which is the ruler.

The `<iframe>` links to `ruler.js`, and `buildRuler(unit1, unit2)` (which is in `ruler.js`), builds the actual ruler with CSS!
